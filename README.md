# Give Them Credit
Give them credit is an open source project still under development that combines music, programming and digital art. Album credits are the lifeblood of musicians but softwares such as ï£¿ Music or Spotify only show headline artists and track titles. The contribution of all the other musicians and technicians is anonymized and minimized. The aim of this project is to literally **give credit** to all those people involved in the process of creating music through the acquisition, analysis and visualization of metadata taken from the [Rovi API](http://developer.rovicorp.com).
